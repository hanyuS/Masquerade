# Masquerade
Introduction :
We have noticed that students in university having trouble making new friends, maybe because they are too busy, too shy, or they are just simply do not know how to make connections with other people. Under this consideration, we made an anonymous chatting app. The main features of Masquerade including interest match, which helps to find you a random contact with same interests, so that it gives you an opportunity to find a person to chat with in this specific topic. With the masks on, you are free to express opinions and you donâ€™t have to worry about any judging. Chatting anonymously can provide you a safe, comfortable and discrimination-free community. When you enjoyed a satisfying chat, you can take off your masks and become true friends.
